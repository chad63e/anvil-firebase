# Firebase Cloud Messaging for Anvil ‚Äî User Guide

This app integrates Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with Anvil. It provides:

- Portable client/server message models (`messages.py`) aligned with FCM Webpush.
- A server-side wrapper (`FirebaseMessaging`) around `firebase_admin.messaging`.
- A preconfigured service worker under `theme/assets/fb-service-worker.js`.

Use it to send push notifications to devices, manage topics, and control Webpush options from Anvil.

## Quick Start

1. Configure a Firebase service account and copy the JSON contents.
2. In the Anvil Editor, add a Secret named `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` and paste the JSON string.
3. In a server module, initialize Firebase Admin and send a test message:

```python
from .server_utils import FCMServiceAccountCredentials
from .server import FirebaseMessaging
from .messages import SimpleMessage, WebpushConfig, WebpushNotification
import anvil.secrets

fm = FirebaseMessaging()
creds_json = anvil.secrets.get_secret("FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON")
creds = FCMServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_string(creds_json)
fm.initialize_firebase_admin(creds)

# Send to a single token
msg = SimpleMessage(
    token="FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN",
    data={"example": "hello"},
    webpush=WebpushConfig(
        notification=WebpushNotification(title="Hello", body="World")
    ),
)
resp = fm.send(msg)
print(resp)  # Inspect result on the server log
```

## Usage Examples

### Subscribe/Unsubscribe to Topics

```python
fm.subscribe_to_topic("news", token)
fm.unsubscribe_from_topic("news", token)
```

### Send Multiple Messages (Batch)

```python
from .messages import Message

messages = [
    Message(token=t, data={"k": "v"})
    for t in ["token1", "token2"]
]
batch = fm.send_all(messages)
print(batch)
```

### Send Multicast Message

```python
from .messages import MulticastMessage

multi = MulticastMessage(
    tokens=["token1", "token2"],
    data={"k": "v"},
)
batch = fm.send_multicast(multi)
```

## Notes and Troubleshooting

- Ensure your service account has permission to use FCM.
- Tokens must be current/valid; handle client token refresh appropriately.
- The service worker at `theme/assets/fb-service-worker.js` handles Webpush events.
- Data payload values are coerced to strings by the server for FCM compliance.

## Browser Compatibility (Microsoft Edge)

- Supported: Chromium-based Edge 79+.
- Not supported: Legacy Edge (EdgeHTML).
- Permissions: Allow Notifications for your site (edge://settings/content/notifications). Windows Focus Assist/Do Not Disturb can suppress toasts; check the Action Center if you do not see a banner.
- Service worker scope: This app serves the worker at `/_/theme/fb-service-worker.js` and binds it with `messaging.useServiceWorker(...)`, which is supported in Edge.
- VAPID key: Edge requires `applicationServerKey` to be a Uint8Array. The client library handles this automatically. If testing manually with `PushManager.subscribe(...)`, convert your base64url public VAPID key to a Uint8Array first.
- InPrivate: InPrivate windows can restrict service worker persistence and notifications. Test in a normal profile.
- Updating the worker: After edits, reload the app or use DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers to "Update"/"Skip waiting". You can also unregister and reload.

Troubleshooting on Edge:

- Verify a service worker is active (DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers).
- Confirm `navigator.serviceWorker.ready` resolves and the registration scope includes `/_/theme/`.
- Check the Console for errors (DevTools, or edge://serviceworker-internals).
- If `InvalidAccessError` occurs when subscribing, regenerate the Web Push VAPID key and make sure you are using the Firebase Cloud Messaging Web Push public key.
